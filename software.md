### R packages

 - ```pcev```; PCEV is a dimension-reduction technique, similar to Principal components Analysis (PCA), which seeks to maximize the proportion of variance (in the response vector) being explained by a set of covariates. The R package implements two estimation methods: the classical approach and a block approach, proposed by Turgeon et al. (submitted), which is suitable for high-dimensional response vectors. The package also performs inference using both analytic and permutation tests. A stable version is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pcev/), and the development version is on [Github](https://github.com/GreenwoodLab/pcev). For more information, have a look at the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pcev/vignettes/pcev.pdf)!
